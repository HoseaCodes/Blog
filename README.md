## Getting Started

The user is brought to the home page where they can navigate to my [portfolio](www.dominiquehosea.com), my blog posts, my about me, or contact page. The home page is an introduction to who I am. The is a brief history of my experience with the option to download my resume. Additionally, I have the technologies that I am currently using, a project showcase, an embbed [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DominiqueRHosea) widget, and testimonies.


## Game Zone

What should I display here? The concept I was going for was like a main game center for my technical command center. Something like mini-games but with my own spin. I wanted users to have the ability to sign up and based off playing the high score, unlocks things on the website and allows you to buy things. The scores/points earned are more like crypto tokens. Also, during extended loading times, they have the ability to play the games to collect points.

### Core Mini-Games for Your Technical Command Center

1. Code Runner - Typing Speed Challenge

```jsx
// A coding-themed typing game where users type code snippets
// Points based on WPM + accuracy
// Unlocks: Advanced code templates, faster deployment tools
```
1. Load Balancer - Resource Management

```jsx
// Distribute incoming requests across servers
// Players drag/drop requests to prevent server overload
// Points for efficiency and uptime
// Unlocks: Infrastructure monitoring tools, deployment credits
``` 
1. Memory Leak Hunter - Pattern Matching

```jsx
// Find and fix memory issues in visual code blocks
// Similar to matching games but with technical concepts
// Points for speed and accuracy
// Unlocks: Debugging tools, performance insights
```

1. API Tetris - System Architecture

```jsx
// Stack API components to build microservices
// Different shapes = different services (auth, database, cache)
// Points for clean architecture and completed systems
// Unlocks: Architecture templates, service blueprints
``` 

1. Crypto Miner - Simple Clicker Game

```jsx
// Perfect for loading screens - just click to mine tokens
// Minimal interaction required
// Steady point accumulation
// Unlocks: Token multipliers, auto-mining tools
```
## Terminal Features

## Architecture

This application uses a dual-backend microservices architecture:

```
Frontend (React on :3000)
    ↓ (JWT token)
Blog Backend (Express on localhost:3001 / Fly.io)
    ↓ MongoDB Atlas
    ↓ (validates token, handles blog/media/AI features)
    ↓
Auth Backend (Express on localhost:8080 / AWS Lambda)
    ↓ MongoDB Atlas
    ↓ (issues tokens, handles authentication)
```

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User logs in via Auth Backend (:8080 / AWS)
2. Auth Backend issues JWT token signed with `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
3. Frontend stores token in cookies
4. All blog operations use same token with Blog Backend (:3001 / Fly.io)
5. Both backends share the same `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` for token validation

**Why Dual Backend?**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Auth logic isolated from business logic
- **Scalability**: Each backend can scale independently
- **Security**: Auth backend can have stricter security policies
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Auth on AWS Lambda, Blog on Fly.io

## Technologies Used

This application was developed with a full MERN stack and written in JavaScript. Styling done with Bootstrap, Material UI, SASS/SCSS and CSS.

**M** - MongoDB, NoSQL database (MongoDB Atlas)  
**E** - Express, a back-end framework (dual backends)  
**R** - React, a client side framework

### Security

#### Shared Secret Architecture

Both backends use the **same `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`** to enable single-token authentication:

```javascript
// Auth Backend (AWS) - Issues token
const token = jwt.sign(
  { id: user._id, role: user.role },
  process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '1d' }
);

// Blog Backend (Fly.io) - Validates same token
jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, user) => {
  if (err) return res.status(401).json({ msg: 'Invalid token' });
  req.user = user;
  next();
});
```

#### JWT Authentication Flow

![Security](https://i.imgur.com/ZD1gtVH.png)

![JWT](https://i.imgur.com/lFIJa0b.png)

1. User submits credentials to Auth Backend (:8080)
2. Auth Backend validates and returns JWT token
3. Frontend stores token in httpOnly cookie
4. All subsequent requests include token in `Authorization` header
5. Both backends validate token with shared secret
6. Token expires after 24 hours, refresh token extends session

See [wiki](https://github.com/HoseaCodes/Blog/wiki/Backend) for details.

## Dev Ops

### Pipelines

Three long-lived branches. Only two of them run CI.

| Branch    | Workflow | Trigger | Runs | Deploys |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------- |
| `staging` | `main.yaml` (Dev Pipeline) | push to `staging` | static-scan → dependency-scan → lint → integration-test → build → promote-dev | Fly.io, on every green build |
| `prep`    | *none* | — | nothing | — |
| `master`  | `master.yaml` (Snyk Scan), `release-please.yml` | push to `master` | security → build; release-please in parallel | via release tag — see below |

> **`prep` has no CI.** No workflow triggers on it and none reference it. Checks
> displayed on a PR that *targets* `prep` are the `staging` pipeline's runs
> against staging's head commit — they say nothing about the merge result.
> `prep`'s own copies of the workflow files are stale: they still trigger on
> `staging` and have no `integration-test` job.

#### Dev Pipeline jobs (`staging`)

| Job Name           | Use Case |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| static-scan        | Static application security testing (SAST). Analyzes source code for vulnerabilities that make the application susceptible to attack. |
| dependency-scan    | Alerts on any open-source component, direct or transitive, that the code depends on and is known to be vulnerable. |
| lint               | Scans source for errors and potential issues that lead to bugs and vulnerabilities. |
| integration-test   | `npm run test:integration` — drives the real Express app over HTTP (supertest) against a real MongoDB (Testcontainers). Outbound third-party HTTP is blocked by `nock`. **Requires Docker.** |
| build              | `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` → `npm run build` → archives `build.tar.gz`, then cuts a `staging.v*` release. |
| promote-dev        | Deploys the built artifact to Fly.io. |

Jobs are gated: `build` needs all four scans/tests to pass, and `promote-dev`
needs `build`. A failure early in the chain means later jobs never execute —
so a green early stage is not evidence that the later ones work.

#### Releases and deploys

| Mechanism | Where | Tag format | Pushes version bump | Drives a deploy |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| conventional-changelog | `staging` build job | `staging.v*` | Yes | No |
| conventional-changelog | `master` build job | `dev.v*` | No | No |
| release-please | `master` | `v*` | Yes, via release PR | Yes |
| `release-publish.yml` | on tag `v*.*.*` | — | — | Deploys to Fly.io |

Two deploy paths:

- **staging** — `promote-dev` deploys to Fly.io directly on every green build.
- **master** — release-please opens a release PR; merging it creates a `v1.2.3`
  tag, which fires `release-publish.yml` and deploys to Fly.io.

#### Pipeline gotchas

- **Never delete `package-lock.json` in CI.** `react-scripts@4.0.3` pins
  `@babel/core` to exactly `7.12.3` while floating `babel-preset-react-app` to
  `^10.0.0`, which resolves to `10.1.0` and requires `^7.16.0`. Resolving
  without the lockfile fails the build with
  `Requires Babel "^7.16.0", but was loaded with "7.12.3"`. Install with
  `npm ci`.
- **The integration suite needs no real API keys.** `test/setup/env.cjs` seeds
  placeholders (including `OPENAI_API_KEY`) before app modules load, and
  `nock.disableNetConnect()` blocks egress. Do not add real third-party
  secrets to CI for tests.
- **Do not construct third-party SDK clients at module scope.** `app.js`
  imports every router at boot, so a client built at import time makes the
  whole app unimportable without that credential — which takes down the
  integration suite before a single test runs. Build clients lazily inside
  handlers.
- **`master` still runs conventional-changelog with `tag-prefix: dev.v` and
  `git-push: false`.** Because the bump is never pushed, `master`'s
  `package.json` drifts behind its `dev.v*` tags, and the job will eventually
  fail on a tag collision the same way `staging` did. Nothing consumes those
  `dev.v*` tags — `release-publish.yml` fires on `v*.*.*`, which they do not
  match. Removing those steps from `master.yaml` is the pending cleanup.
