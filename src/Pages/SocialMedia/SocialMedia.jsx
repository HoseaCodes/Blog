//You can include your social media on 
//your homepage, in your “About Me”, 
//“Contact” section, or on the page or 
//pages that you think best. Only include 
//social media that you use consistently 
//for professional purpose. If you use a 
//social media platform primarily for 
//personal engagement, there is no need to 
//include that information on your website. 
//Also, you should only include social 
//media that you use actively and regularly. 
//For example, if you haven’t Tweeted in 
//six months, you’re better off leaving 
//your Twitter account off of your website, 
//otherwise you can come across as disengaged 
//to your audience. The social media that you 
//include on your website should be used to 
//convey your thought leadership. See below f
//or more information.
