//Testimonials are an optional feature that 
//can help make your website more impactful. 
//Ask internal or external clients, 
//colleagues, and supervisors for 
//testimonials that speak to your skill set 
//and your unique value proposition. Avoid 
//including testimonials that are general 
//and that don’t support your brand statement. 
//You can use your LinkedIn recommendations on 
//your website, or an edited snippet from a 
//longer LinkedIn recommendation. Aim to 
//showcase one to five short, powerful 
//testimonials. It is not necessary to include 
//a separate tab of testimonials. You can 
//include testimonials on your homepage, 
//“About Me” section, or with the projects 
//that you showcase in your portfolio section, 
//if the testimonial is directly related to one 
//of the projects that you are showcasing. 
//Testimonials are optional, so don’t feel 
//like your website is incomplete without them. 
//If you don’t have any testimonials currently, 
//consider making it a goal to gather some as 
//you progress in your career, and update your 
//website at a later date.
