//Make it easy for your audience to 
//contact you. You can create a separate 
//“Contact” section, a “Contact” 
//call-to-action button, or both. One 
//best practice is to include multiple, 
//easily accessible ways for your audience 
//to contact you, as they navigate their 
//way through your website. Include a 
//contact form, your email address, or 
//both in this section. It’s not necessary 
//to include your phone number or address 
//in your website’s contact information.

import React from 'react';

const Contact = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Contact</h1>
        </div>
    )

}

export default Contact;
