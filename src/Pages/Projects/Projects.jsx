//The “Portfolio” section often titled
//“Projects” is an opportunity for you 
//to present your best work to your 
//audience, and bring your skills and 
//abilities to life in a way that other 
//job search collateral doesn’t allow. 
//In this section you can curate an 
//ever-evolving collection of your best work, 
//and tell the story behind each project. 
//Your portfolio should be a clear demonstration 
//of your skills, as well as your work process 
//and problem solving abilities. Reflect on your 
//brand statement and aim to illustrate your value 
//proposition and skills with each project, 
//showing your audience what you do and how you do it.
//Add photo and video artifacts of your work process, 
//including outlines, sketches, doodles, prototypes, 
//wireframes, lists, and Post-its, that document your 
//work process and problem solving skills. Include a 
//case study for each project, to ensure that you are 
//detailing your project and work process in clear, 
//concise, yet robust way. Use the case story to tell 
//the story of your project in your authentic voice. 
//Provide your audience with a clear, concise introduction 
//or overview, and walk them through your work process 
//from start to final product.
//In your case study, include the client, their location, 
//and industry. Detail what the desired outcomes were, 
//and who the audience or ultimate end user will be for 
//the product or service that you created. Include any 
//assumptions that you made about potential challenges 
//and risks. Inform your audience about your role in the 
//project, and mention any team members involved. 
//Explain any problems that you encountered along the 
//way, and the solutions you applied to solve those 
//problems. Note any technology used, and describe the 
//final results. Communicate lessons learned along the way, 
//the skills gained from this project, and why you found 
//the project fulfilling and rewarding. Use clear headings 
//to make your case study easy to navigate, and weave your 
//case study like a story, guiding your audience through 
//your entire project process. You can use this case study 
//template to help guide you as you plan and craft your case 
//study.
//When formatting your “Portfolio” section, consider offering 
//the reader a high level, at-a-glance view of all your 
//projects. Allow them to choose which project they would like 
//to explore further by providing your audience with a clear 
//project overview, highlighting important information upfront.
//Aim to showcase a minimum of three projects on your website. 
//You might only have one project to showcase at the moment, 
//and there’s no shame in that. Everyone needs to start somewhere. 
//Just be sure that the one project that you have to showcase 
//is robust and is supported by a thoughtful case study. If 
//you have an abundance of projects to showcase, choose to 
//highlight your best work on your website. Strive to show 
//growth over time with your projects, and vary the types of 
//projects that you showcase to show a versatility of skill.
//If you are eager to showcase additional and current projects 
//on your website, you can and should include pro bono or 
//freelance work that you are doing as a side project, or a 
//passion project that you completed to challenge yourself, 
//learn and apply new skills, and stay current. It’s important 
//to include these projects because you want to demonstrate to 
//your audience that you are Your professional website should 
//showcase your thought leadership. Update your audience on 
//the work that you are doing, beyond the showcased projects 
//in your portfolio section. It is particularly important to 
//update your audience about your recent activities if you are 
//actively seeking work. This will show that you are intellectually 
//curious, current, active, and working to continuously build and 
//hone your skills. Show your audience what you are planning, 
//thinking about, looking forward to, and how you are using your 
//skills and staying current. Share insights gained from side 
//projects that you are working on or a new program that you 
//recently learned. If you’ve been part of a design challenge 
//or hackathon, let your audience know.
