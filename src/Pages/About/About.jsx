//Include an “About Me” section in your website. T
//he “About Me” section is an opportunity to expand 
//on the introduction that you offer to your audience 
//when they arrive on your homepage. In this section 
//you show some of your personality and let your audience 
//connect with the person behind the work. Tap into your 
//professional story and your value proposition, and highlight 
//what you do, why you do it, and how you do it. 
//You can communicate how you became motivated to start a career 
//in your desired industry, what drives you currently, 
//the problems that you solve, and your current industry-related
//passions. There is no need to include extensive details or your 
//whole life story in the “About Me” section. Stick to the what, 
//why, and how of your professional story, and any personal 
//information that impacted or informed your professional story.
//You can include some additional, brief details about your 
//personal life in the “About Me” section, after you’ve detailed 
//your professional story. You can include information about your 
//interests, hobbies, pets, kids, partner, and geographic location. 
//Including this information can help your audience connect with 
//the person behind the work. It is important, however, to keep 
//the personal details brief and not too personal. Remember that 
//we want to cast the widest net when job searching. Use your 
//judgement and avoid including any personal details that could 
//be interpreted as less than positive by anyone in your audience.
//If you have another passion, particularly if that passion 
//compliments the work that you will be doing in your desired 
//industry, it’s also acceptable to include this information in 
//your “About Me” section. For example, if you’re a UX designer, 
//who also has a passion and talent for graphic design, you can 
//include information about your graphic design skills, and 
//include a link to your graphic design website. If you do 
//include information about a secondary passion, be sure that your 
//messaging around this interest is brief and doesn’t distract 
//from your primary messaging around your career interest.
//You can consider including a photo of yourself in the “About Me” 
//section. Adding a photo can help your audience connect with you. 
//Some job seekers include professional headshots, while others 
//opt for action photos that show them engaging in the work that 
//they are interested in doing professionally. Whichever type of 
//photo you include, it should be high-quality and represent your 
//personal brand.
//Make sure to include a downloadable PDF version of your resume in 
//your “About Me” section as well.
