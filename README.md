<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Homepage](https://i.imgur.com/5k3N3ex.png)

The user is brought to the home page where they can navigate to my [portfolio](www.dominiquehosea.com), my blog posts, my about me, or contact page. The home page is an introduction to who I am. The is a brief history of my experience with the option to download my resume. Additionally, I have the technologies that I am currently using, a project showcase, an embbed [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DominiqueRHosea) widget, and testimonies.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
